> A machine learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using clinical data.

This project implements a **Breast Cancer Classification Model** using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** from Kaggle. It uses **Logistic Regression** to classify tumors as either **Benign (B)** or **Malignant (M)** based on 30 features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
